                    - Assess whether the resume clearly communicates the candidate‚Äôs skills, achievements, and career trajectory.

                    - Evaluate formatting, keyword usage, and structure for ATS readability.

                    - Point out areas that weaken its effectiveness.

                    - Organize your feedback under clear sections:

                    - Add a brief, encouraging closing remark.

                    Your response must be professional, structured, and highly actionable.
